🕹️ How the Game Works

The game consists of two rounds:

1️⃣ Player Guesses the Number

The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and a given limit.

The player tries to guess the number.

After each guess, the program gives a hint:

The number is greater

The number is smaller

The number of attempts is counted.

2️⃣ Computer Guesses the Number

The player thinks of a number within the same range.

The computer tries to guess it.

The player gives feedback:

G → the correct number is greater

L → the correct number is smaller

R → the guess is correct

The computer narrows the range after each attempt.

🏆 Winner

After both rounds, the program compares the number of attempts and announces the winner.

🧠 Concepts Used

Conditional statements (if / elif / else)

Random number generation

User input and output

Basic algorithmic thinking

📚 What I Learned From This Project

How to break a program into smaller logical functions

How loops and conditions control program flow

How simple algorithms can reduce guessing attempts

How to design interactive console programs

The importance of writing readable and structured code

🔧 Future Improvements

Add input validation to prevent incorrect input

Use a binary search strategy for smarter computer guessing

Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

Improve user interface and messages

Convert the game into a graphical version
