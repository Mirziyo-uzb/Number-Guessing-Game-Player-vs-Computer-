# Number Guessing Game (Player vs Computer)

This is a simple interactive Python game where both the player and the computer try to guess a number within a given range.

The project was created as part of my journey into programming and computer science, focusing on logical thinking and problem-solving rather than just syntax.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

The game has two parts:

1. **Player guesses the number**
   - The computer randomly selects a number.
   - The player tries to guess it.
   - The program gives hints: greater or smaller.

2. **Computer guesses the number**
   - The player thinks of a number.
   - The computer guesses it using a narrowing range strategy.
   - The player provides feedback: greater, less, or correct.

After both rounds, the program compares attempts and declares a winner.
